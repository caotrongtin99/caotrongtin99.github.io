As a result, when you change either the source or the copy, you may also cause the other object to change too — and so, you may end up unintentionally causing changes to the source or copy that you don&amp;rsquo;t expect.</description>

      <description>Table of Contents Memory Leak Solve the problem Some memory leak cases in React In conclusion Memory Leak Memory leak is a type of resource leak that occurs when a computer program incorrectly manages memory allocations. Sometimes, we get a warning about memory leak in our React applications such as Can&amp;rsquo;t perform a React state update on an unmounted component. We shouldn&amp;rsquo;t update state in an unmounted component. For example, we are fetching data at the first mouting to update component states, but we immediately navigate to another page or take other actions to make the component unmounted so state updating becomes unuseful.</description>
